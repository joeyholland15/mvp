There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  What Should I Wear?

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Where travelers and commuters can go to check the weather at their destination. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  This product uses a public weather api to report the weather at a particular location. Those who commute to work
  or are planning a trip can compare the temperature/precipitation where they are to that of where they are headed.

  Users can also input clothes that they own, and the app will tell them what to wear based on their inventory and
  the compared temperature of the destination. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Getting to work or flying to a destination and realizing it's far warmer or colder (or raining) than where they 
  came from and not being prepared with the proper clothing. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  This product solves the problem by allowing users to check ahead of time what they'll need to bring. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Our service helps users from catching a cold after stepping off the plain in a different city or sweating through their jackets when they arrive at work."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  It's easy to get started! Just enter any clothing you may have and enter the zipcode of where you're coming from and where you're headed. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "My four-year-old daughter didn't want to put her jacket on before we got on the plane to go home. Thanks to this service I was able to check the weather at home and see that it was snowing! I told her she couldn't make a snowman unless she put her jacket on. "

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
